# gsh

## Basically a Go shell script to learn the language.

You can help me to keep this program simple and stupid, i'm learning so don't also correct everything directly and let me dig the problem a bit with my stupid mind.

Thank you.

### I'm not responsible of any damage taken or due with this program, i'm just beginning programming in Go so DONT'T EVER use it in production. Or at YOUR OWN risks.
